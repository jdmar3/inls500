This repository houses the source files for INLS 500-001 course website and syllabus. 

The course description, as it appears in the UNC course catalog:

"The behavioral and cognitive activities of those who interact with information, with emphasis on the role of information mediators. How information needs are recognized and resolved; use and dissemination of information."

INLS 500 is a course that surveys human information interactions through broad examination of information science literature. 
Students examine cognitive, social, organizational/institutional, and behavioral approaches to understanding interactions between people and information.
Emphasis is placed on the role of the information professional or information scientist as mediator, and students are encouraged to apply analyze current events and situations.

This course undergirds much of the SILS curriculum because it introduces students to core concepts that have implications for the practice of information science and librarianship. 
It is expected that it will be taken during the first or second semester of the student's career at SILS.
