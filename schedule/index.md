## Tuesday, August 25 

### <span id="session3"></span>\#3: Theoretical perspectives and basic concepts

Due: Title of article for [Evidence Summary](/assignments/#evidencesummary)

Each of these two readings takes a slightly different view of our field
and, in particular, the portion of our field surveyed in this course.

Bates, M. J. (1999). The invisible substrate of information science.
*Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 50*(12),
1043-1050. \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1999)50:12<1043::AID-ASI1>3.0.CO;2-X)\]

In this article, Bates discusses the "below-the-water-line" portion of information science. 
While she focuses more of her attention on the content/information of concern, she does include human-information interactions among her "Three Big Questions" in information science.
Read through this article quickly, to get an overview of the field as background for the semester.

Marchionini, G. (2008). Human-information interaction. *Library &amp; Information Science Research, 30*(3), 165-174. \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2008.07.001)\]

Marchionini focuses more directly on the scope of this course. Read through the entire article, but focus special attention on sections 2 and 6.

## Thursday, August 27 

### <span id="session4"></span>\#4 Cognitive approaches to information behaviors

Dinet, J., Chevalier, A., &amp; Tricot, A. (2012). Information search
activity: An overview. *Revue européene de psychologie appliqué,
62*(2)*,* 49-62. (Read sections 2.1-2.2.1.) \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erap.2012.03.004)\]

A number of models of information seeking are briefly reviewed here. Of
particular interest are those described in sections 2.1-2.2.1 (as
background for understanding the Ingwersen and Järvelin model.)

Ingwersen, P., &amp; Järvelin, K. (2005). *The Turn: Integration of
Information Seeking and Retrieval in Context.*Springer. \[[UNC libraries
- electronic
resource](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/10.1007/1-4020-3851-8)\]

Section 6.1, Building the conceptual framework, p. 263-274. This section
of this important book walks through the model that the authors are
proposing. They believe that the model encompassses all of the
information behaviors of interest to our field. The cognitive aspects of
those information behaviors are at center stage. (Feel free to skim
other parts of chapter 6 if you have time.)

## Tuesday, September 1 

### <span id="session5"></span>\#5: Affective approaches

Kuhlthau, C., Heinström, J., &amp; Todd, R.J. (2008). The 'information
search process' revisited: Is the model still useful? *Information
Research, 13*(4), Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Information
Seeking in Context, Vilnius, September 2008).
<http://informationr.net/ir/13-4/paper355.html>.

Kuhlthau's model of the information search process is well-known and
widely-used to understand the process that people go through while
searching for information. It includes their cognitive behaviors (such a
learning) as well as their feelings and how they vary throughout the
process. The model itself is summarized in Figure 1; to read the
original work on it, see the two Kuhlthau articles listed as optional
reading, plus her book.

Lopatovska, I., &amp; Arapakis, I. (2011). Theories, methods and current
research on emotions in library and information science, information
retrieval and human-computer interaction. *Information Processing &amp;
Management, 47*(4), 575-592. \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2010.09.001)\]

This literature review provides a strong foundation for moving forward
with research about emotions and their relationships with information
behaviors. Focus your reading on sections 2 and 4.1. The first and last
sections are overviews, so will help you put the detail into context.
Skim section 3, just to get a sense of what methods have been used in
studies of emotions.

Information Needs
-----------------

## Thursday, September 3

### <span id="session6"></span>\#6: Experiencing an information need

Case, D.O. (2012). Information needs and information seeking. In
*Looking for Information: A Survey of Research on Information Seeking,
Needs, and Behavior.* 3rd edition. Boston: Academic Press, 77-83. \[book
on reserve in SILS Library - ZA3075 .L665 2012\]<span
class="amcc">\[IN SAKAI\]</span>

This chapter summarizes what we know about people's information needs,
so will provide you with a good overview.

Taylor, R.S. (1968). Question negotiation and information seeking in
libraries. *College &amp; Research Libraries, 29*(3),178-194. (Read about
the four levels of "questions," on pages 182-183; we'll come back to the
rest in a few weeks.) <span class="amcc">\[IN SAKAI\]</span>

This is a classic reading, so you'll want to eventually study it all.
For now, we want to focus our attention on Taylor's explanation of
visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.

Savolainen, R. (2006). Information use as gap-bridging: The viewpoint of
sense-making methodology. *Journal of the American Society for
Information Science &amp; Technology, 57*(8), 1116-1125. \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20400)\]

Brenda Dervin has proposed a Sense-Making Theory to explain how people
experience information needs and act on them. In this article,
Savolainen focuses on gaps (i.e., information needs). One of Dervin's
articles on this theory and an additional article on it by Savolainen
are listed among the optional readings for today.

## Tuesday, September 8

### <span id="session7"></span>\#7: Expressing information needs

Belkin, N. (1980). Anomalous states of knowledge as a basis for
information retrieval. *Canadian Journal of Information Science,
5*,133-143. <span class="amcc">\[IN SAKAI\]</span>

This, along with his 1982 *Journal of Documentation* article with Oddy
and Brooks, are the classic works explaining this concept. It's a
relatively straightforward concept; I'd like you to pay special
attention to his explanation of the specifiability of an information
need, p136-139, with Figure 3.

Sparck-Jones, K., Robertson, S.E., &amp; Sanderson, M. (2007). Ambiguous
requests: Implications for retrieval tests, systems and theories. *ACM
SIGIR Forum, 41*(2), 8-17. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1328964.1328965)\]

The problem of clear specification of information needs still causes
worries for those of us who want to design effective information
retrieval systems. You'll enjoy reading this relatively recent
discussion of the problem by three of the field's leaders.

Nückles, M., &amp; Ertelt, A. (2006). The problem of describing a problem:
Supporting laypersons in presenting their queries to the internet-based
helpdesk. *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 64*(8),
648-669. (Read sections 1-3, p648-651.) \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.01.001)\]

The literature on expressing information needs covers a broad range of
questions and domains. This article focuses on a particular situation: a
computer user trying to request help in using a computer. The authors
were particularly interested in developing a "script" that the user
would fill out, in order to provide complete and accurate information to
the expert/helper, but we'll focus our discussion on the more conceptual
aspects of this problem, described in the first few sections of the
article.

Bates, M.E. (1998). Finding the question behind the question.
*Information Outlook, 2*(7), 19-21. <span class="amcc">\[WILL ADD TO
SAKAI\]</span>

For some very practical advice about helping library users to express
their information needs, check out this article. I believe that you'll
find this advice reminiscent of Taylor's 1968 suggestions for filtering
the questions received at the library reference desk.

## Thursday, September 10

### <span id="session8"></span>\#8: Literature searching review lab (some practice in expressing your own information needs) 

Bring your laptop to class.

Koufogiannakis, D. (2013). EBLIP7 Keynote: What we talk about when we
talk about evidence. *Evidence Based Library and Information Practice,
8*(4), 6-17.
<http://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/EBLIP/article/view/20486>.

This article will help you understand Assignment 3 a bit better, and
will help us understand what we're looking for during our searching lab.

## Tuesday, September 15 

### <span id="session9"></span>\#9: Studying and analyzing information needs

Due: Brief description for [Diary and Analysis of an Information Seeking
Event](/assignments/#eventdiary)

<span class="todo">Read and be prepared to discuss at least one
additional article. </span> Select an article (or articles) that analyze
the information needs of a particular group (other than college/graduate
students or scholars). Select your own or choose from the optional
reading list.

Herman, E. (2004). Research in progress: Some preliminary and key
insights into the information needs of the contemporary academic
research. Part 1. *Aslib Proceedings, 56*(1), 34-47. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00012530410516859)\]

Based on interviews with faculty at the University of Haifa, Herman
investigated 11 aspects of information needs: subject, function, nature,
intellectual level, viewpoint, quantity, quality/authority,
date/currency, speed of delivery, place of publication/origina, and
processing/packaging. This paper focuses only on the subject and
function of their information needs; Part 2, listed in our optional
readings, provides more detail on other aspects of their information
needs.

Gabridge, C., Gaskell, M., &amp; Stout, A. (2008). Information seeking
through students' eyes: The MIT Photo Diary Study. *College &amp; Research
Libraries, 69*(6), 510-523. \[[UNC
libraries](http://crl.acrl.org/content/69/6/510.full.pdf+html)\]

This article is a good example of a study carried out in an academic
library to understand students' information needs and information
seeking behaviors.

Information-Seeking
-------------------

## Thursday, September 17

### <span id="session10"></span>\#10: Selection of information sources

Savolainen, R. (2008). Source preferences in the context of seeking
problem-specific information. *Information Processing &amp; Management,
44*(1): 274-293. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2007.02.008)\]

Savolainen uses the concepts of information source horizon and
information pathway to study the sources people use in resolving
everyday information needs. You'll want to read the entire paper, to get
a good feel for both the concepts and his findings.

Lu, L, &amp; Yuan, Y.C. (2011). Shall I Google it or ask the competent
villain down the hall? The moderating role of information need in
information source selection. *Journal of the American Society for
Information Science &amp; Technology, 62*(1), 133-145. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.21449)\]

This study looks at the tradeoffs that people make when selecting an
information source, between the quality of the source and the
accessibility of the source. The literature review will be particularly
useful. The study itself, particularly the analysis, is fairly complex,
but skim it to understand the main findings and their implications for
practice.

## Thursday, September 24

### <span id="session12"></span>\#12: Interactive information retrieval as part of the information seeking process

Due: Description of population and setting of interest for [System/Service Proposal](/assignments/#proposal)

Marchionini, G. (2006). Exploratory search: From finding to
understanding. *Communications of the ACM, 49*(4), 41-46. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1121949.1121979)\]

Exploratory search is differentiated from lookup searches (including
fact retrieval, known item searches, etc.) and incorporates searches
conducted for the purposes of learning and investigating. A few examples
of systems that support exploratory search are presented.

Vakkari, P., &amp; Huuskonen, S. (2012). Search effort degrades search
output but improves task outcome. *Journal of the American Society for
Information Science &amp; Technology, 63*(4), 657-670. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.21683)\]

Unlike most studies of searching, this study goes beyond the link
between search behaviors and search results and also examines the link
between search results and task outcomes.

Saarinen, K., &amp; Vakkari, P. (2013). A sign of a good book: Readers'
methods of accessing fiction in the public library. *Journal of
Documentation, 69*(5), 736-754. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JD-04-2012-0041)\]

Most IR systems are designed to support retrieving non-fiction. This
study examines how public library users search for fiction, with an eye
toward designing systems that will support such searches. Skim sections
1-3, so that you can focus your attention on sections 4 and 5 (pages
744-752).

## Tuesday, September 29

### <span id="session13"></span>\#13: Assessment of information quality and value

Due: Description of population and setting of interest for [System/Service Proposal](/assignments/#proposal)

These two studies are examining very similar behaviors, so we'll focus
our attention on the differences between them. Pay attention to the
research questions asked, who is included in the study sample, what data
were collected, and what conclusions were drawn.

Rieh, S.Y. (2002). Judgment of information quality and cognitive
authority in the Web. *Journal of the American Society for Information
Science &amp; Technology, 53*(2), 145-161. \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.10017)\]

Tombros, A., Ruthven, I., &amp; Jose, J.M. (2005). How users assess web

## Thursday, October 1

### <span id="session13"></span>\#14: Relevance judgments

Due: Preliminary literature search plan for [System/Service Proposal](/assignments/#proposal)

Saracevic, T. (2007). Relevance: A review of the literature and a
framework for thinking on the notion in information science. Part II:
Nature and manifestations of relevance, \[and\] Part III: Behavior and
effects of relevance. *Journal of the American Society for Information
Science &amp; Technology, 58*(13), 1915-1933, 2126-2144. \[UNC libraries:
[Part
II](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20682),
[Part
III](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20681)\]

Part I of this series is his 1975 article on the topic of relevance. In
this update, he provides a really-compact overview of a huge amount of
the literature on relevance. Read these two parts for the primary
concepts, not necessarily for the nuanced details.

Xie, I., &amp; Benoit, E., III. (2013). Search result list evaluation versus
document evaluation: Similarities and differences. *Journal of
Documentation, 69*(1), 49-80. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00220411311295324)\]

Making a relevance judgment based on the snippet in a results list is
different than making a relevance judgment based on the full document.
Xie and Benoit looked closely at these two processes, to identify both
the similarities and differences. Lightly skim the introduction and
literature review, to see the similarities with the Saracevic articles
(and also identify any new ideas); focus your reading on their results
and discussion (pages 60-76).

# Information Use

## Tuesday, October 6

### <span id="session15"></span>\#15: Ways of using information / re-finding and re-use

find and refind information. *IEEE Computer, 38*(10), 36-42. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MC.2005.355)\]

Finding and refinding present different user challenges. Synthesizing
results from one of their studies with related work, the authors propose
a search engine use model based on prior task frequency and familiarity.

Jones, W., Bruce, H., &amp; Dumais, S. (2001). Keeping found things found on

This is one of the earliest serious studies of re-finding and re-use,
based on observation of the methods people use to manage web information
for re-use.

This paper provides an overview of the issues associated with the
quantity and diversity of information now available. Read the entire
paper, but focus particular attention on sections 3 and 4 (in case
you're feeling overloaded).

# Unit 5: The Impact of Context on Information Seeking and Use

## Tuesday, October 20

### <span id="session18"></span>\#18: Domain, disciplinary, and organizational context

Today will be a review or sorts. 
We will begin with an overview of topics we have covered in the course so far and then move into a discussion of how context affects information behavior to develop a better sense of what we should be looking for in our research.

ARIST chapters are comprehensive literature reviews in a particular
area. Of interest to us in this chapter is the section on "Situation,
context, and interaction with information," pages 7-9. It will introduce
you to a bit of the terminology in this area. The chapter, as a whole,
is organized around several theoretical perspectives on situation: the
problematic situation, social interaction theory, situated action,
situation awareness, the person-in-situation model, and situation as
information environment.

This is the seminal article on everyday life information seeking, which
is now an important area of information behavior research. One question
for us is which types of everyday life information needs are we likely
to be able to address via our current information institutions or
systems. See the "additional readings" for Savolainen's book on this
research area, and the Givens (2002) paper on that list for an
investigation of how much students' academic and everyday information
needs overlap.

Fisher and her students have been developing the concept of an
information ground. This chapter reviews several of her studies that
address the definition of this concept. For an example of a single
well-developed study of information grounds, see the JASIST (2004)
article on the "additional readings" list.

Skim quickly, to get her idea of berrypicking as a metaphor for
information seeking. Also, pay special attention to the techniques
listed on page 412; you're expected to incorporate all of them in your
searching for Assignment 3.

behavioural science research. *Information Research, 12*(4), Paper 330.
\[<http://informationr.net/ir/12-4/paper330.html>\]

Bates take a very fine-grained look at browsing behaviors and finds a
series of four steps: "1) glimpsing a field of vision, 2) selecting or
sampling a physical or informational object within the field of vision,
3) examining the object, 4) acquiring the object (conceptually and/or
physically) or abandoning it."

This paper argues that the design of remote help-giving systems should
be grounded in the methodical ways in which help-givers and help-seekers
coordinate their problem solving activities. They call this coordination
process, "articulation work".

Based on focus groups and town hall meetings, six trends in reference
services were identified. Of particular interest to us for today's
discussion are the results related to reference services as a
collaborative process (p239), but do make sure you understand the other
trends, too.

Twenty-five interactions between information seekers and intermediaries
were examined. The interaction had a positive impact on the search
process. Specifically, the intermediary helped the users to identify
their search terms more clearly and focus on the references obtained.

Through the social process of disintermediation, traditional
intermediaries are replaced by what Eysenbach calls apomediaries (online
tools and peers that will guide information seekers to trustworthy
information). While Eysenbach is focused on the medical domain, his
views may apply equally well to other domains.
