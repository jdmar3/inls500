# Reading science

Reading science is different than reading other forms of literature. 
The purpose of science writing is to communicate the results of empirical studies such that they can be used to support new science and future studies. 
Science is incremental. 
It builds on past work, allowing what we know, collectively, to grow and change over time. 

The guides below will help you to read and evaluate science writing for the purposes of this class and other classes you will take.

## Differences in epistemology and approach

It's important to understand the limitations of our approaches to research. 
Often these limitations can be expressed through epistemology. 
It also helps to consider how our methods are related to our worldview. 
Our reading of research is also similarly affected. 
This guide helps to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative research. 
It also may help to understand the parallels between the two.
