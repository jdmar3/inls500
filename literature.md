INTRODUCTION / BASIC CONCEPTS
-----------------------------------------------------

### <span id="session1"></span>1: Trends in human information interaction research

-   Saracevic, T. (1999). Information science. *Journal of the American
    Society for Information Science, 50*(12), 1051-1063. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1999)50:12<1051::AID-ASI2>3.0.CO;2-Z)\]
    -   Saracevic provides his own "personal analysis" of the field of
        information science (note: more broadly defined than the scope
        of this particular course), with special emphasis on its
        origins, the central role of problems in information retrieval,
        and the relationship between information science
        and librarianship.

### <span id="session2"></span>2:Theoretical perspectives and basic concepts

-   Buckland, M.K. (1991). Information as thing. *Journal of the
    American Society for Information Science, 42*(5), 351-360. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199106)42:5<351::AID-ASI5>3.0.CO;2-3)\]
    -   As you read the assigned Marchionini article, you may have
        noticed that he referenced this article. In it, Buckland
        examines three meanings of information: information as process,
        information as knowledge, and information as thing. He argues
        that the field of information and library science should be
        particular interested in information as thing. Also, if you've
        heard references to antelopes as information objects, this is
        the source.
-   Meadow, C.T., & Yuan, W. (1997). Measuring the impact of
    information: Defining the concepts. *Information Processing &
    Management, 33*(6), 697-714. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4573(97)00042-3)\]
    -   Meadow and Yuan have been frustrated by the many different
        definitions of information used in the field of
        information science. They begin with the classic Shannon and
        Weaver model of the flow of information from an information
        source to a receiver, and then provide an overview of the
        definitions used along the continuum from data to information
        to knowledge.
-   Case, D.O. (2012). The concept of information. In *Looking for
    Information: A Survey of Research on Information Seeking, Needs, and
    Behavior*. 3rd edition. Boston: Academic Press, 45-75. \[SILS
    Library Reserves - ZA3075 .L665 2012\]
    -   In addition to reviewing the various definitions of information
        that are currently in use, Case analyzes the problems with
        each definition.

### <span id="session3"></span>3: Cognitive approaches to information behaviors

-   Ford, N. (2004). Modeling cognitive processes in information
    seeking: from Popper to Pask. *Journal of the American Society for
    Information Science & Technology, 55*(9), 769-782. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20021)\]
    -   Ford is most well-known for his investigations of the effects of
        cognitive style on searching behavior. In this article, he
        reviews and integrates a number of models of information seeking
        that emphasize the cognitive processes involved.
-   Jansen, B.J., Booth, D., & Smith, B. (2009). Using the taxonomy of
    cognitive learning to model online searching. *Information
    Processing & Management, 45*(6), 643-663. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2009.05.004)\]
    -   This study examines cognitive activity during searching in terms
        of a taxonomy of learning tasks. Different search behaviors are
        associated with different levels of searching/learning tasks.
-   JÃ¤rvelin, K., & Ingwersen, P. (2004). Information seeking research
    needs extension towards tasks and technology. *Information Research,
    10*(1).
    [http://informationr.net/ir/10-1/paper212.html.](http://informationr.net/ir/10-1/paper212.html)
    -   In this article, the authors present the model that was included
        in their book (note: this article was published first), and
        discuss how it expands the context of information seeking and
        retrieval research.
-   Robson, A., & Robinson, L. (2013). Building on models of information
    behaviour: Linking information seeking and communication. *Journal
    of Documentation, 69*(2), 169-193. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00220411311300039)\]
    -   Robson and Robinson analyze several models of information
        seeking, selecting key elements they have in common. They then
        combine those elements with elements from models of
        communication processes.
-   Godbold, N. (2006). Beyond information seeking: Towards a general
    model of information behaviour. *Information Research, 11*(4),
    paper 269. <http://informationr.net/ir/11-4/paper269.html>.
    -   After briefly summarizing some of the major theories of
        information behaviors, Goldbold extends Wilson's model by
        considering multi-directionality and additional modes of
        information behaviors (creating, destroying, and
        avoiding information).
-   Warwick, C., Rimmer, J., Blandford, A., Gow, J., & Buchanan, G.
    (2009). Cognitive economy and satisficing in information seeking: A
    longitudinal study of undergraduate information behavior. *Journal
    of the American Society for Information Science & Technology,
    60*(12), 2402-2415. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.21179)\]
    -   This is a typical study of information seeking/searching, with
        its focus on the cognitive aspects of the process. This
        perspective in many studies of students, partly because the
        searching activities are associated with school assignments.
        There are many other studies that you might also look at, as
        examples, but this is one that is well-designed
        and well-executed.

### <span id="session4"></span>4: Alternatives: Affective and physical approaches

-   Kuhlthau, C.C. (1988). Developing a model of the library search
    process: Cognitive and affective aspects. *RQ, 28*(2), 232-242.
    \[Available online via UNC libraries (in html); also in SILS
    Library\]
    -   This is, I believe, the earliest report of Kuhlthau's
        dissertation work, that is the basis of her information search
        process model.
-   Kuhlthau, C.C. (1991). Inside the search process: Information
    seeking from the user's perspective. *Journal of the American
    Society for Information Science, 42*(5), 361-371. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199106)42:5<361::AID-ASI6>3.0.CO;2-#)\]
    -   This is my personal favorite description of Kuhlthau's
        information search process model.
-   Fainburg, L.I. (2009). Information seeking and learning: A
    comparison of Kuhlthau's information seeking model and John Dewey's
    problem solving model. *New Library World, 110*(9/10), 457-466.
    \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03074800910997472)\]
    -   This analysis emphasizes the close relationship between thinking
        and action in both models, that both processes are easier when
        the problem is more focused, and that the two models differ in
        their explication of the role of emotions.
-   Nahl, D. (2007). Social-biological information technology: An
    integrated conceptual framework. *Journal of the America Society for
    Information Science & Technology, 58*(13), 2021-2046. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20690)\]
    -   In this article, Nahl lays out a fairly complex, but
        comprehensive, socio-biological model of information behaviors.
        It includes affective, cognitive, and sensorimotor
        (i.e., physical) activities, and also depicts a
        social dimension. You can also read a similar overview of the
        model in the first chapter of: Nahl, D., & Bilal, D. (eds.),
        *Information and Emotion: The Emergent Affective Paradigm in
        Information Behavior Research and Theory.* Medford, NJ:
        Information Today (for ASIST), 2007.
-   Nahl, D., & Tenopir, C. (1996). Affective and cognitive searching
    behavior of novice end-users of a full-text database. *Journal of
    the American Society for Information Science,* *47*(4), 276-286.
    \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199604)47:4<276::AID-ASI3>3.0.CO;2-U)\]
    -   Over multiple sessions, novice searchers conducted searches of a
        full-text magazine database. Some of the cognitive behaviors of
        interest were the actual uses of the information retrieved.
        Quesitons users asked during the searches were recorded;
        affective questions outnumbered cognitive and
        sensorimotor (physical) questions 2 to 1.
-   Fulton, C. (2009). The pleasure principle: The power of positive
    affect in information seeking. *Aslib Proceedings, 61*(3), 245-261.
    \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00012530910959808)\]
    -   This is an example of a study focusing specifically on the
        affective aspects of information behaviors by interviewing
        amateur genealogists who were hunting for information about
        their Irish ancestors. They found pleasure in the
        search process.
-   Tenopir, C., Wang, P., Zhang, Y., Simmons, B., & Pollard, R. (2008).
    Academic users' interactions with ScienceDirect in search tasks:
    Affective and cognitive behaviors. *Information Processing &
    Management, 44*(1), 105-121. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2006.10.007)\]
    -   Students, faculty, and librarians participated in this study of
        online searching. Learning style was captured through a
        questionnaire; affective behaviors were captured by coding
        particular words uttered during think-aloud protocols; and
        search behaviors were videotaped. The authors examined the
        relationships among these different variables.
-   Norman, D.A. (2002). Emotion & design: Attractive things
    work better. *interactions, 9*(4), 36-42. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/543434.543435)\]
    -   In this magazine for HCI practitioners, Norman reviews recent
        research that indicates that people perform more successfully if
        they are happy when they're interacting with a system. This idea
        is elaborated in his 2003 book, *Emotional Design: Why We Love
        (or Hate) Everyday Things*.
-   Kalbach, J. (2004). Feeling lucky? Emotions and information seeking.
    *interactions, 11*(5), 66-67. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1015530.1015563)\]
-   Kalbach, J. (2006). "I'm feeling lucky": The role of emotions in
    seeking information on the Web. *Journal of the American Society for
    Information Science & Technology, 57*(6), 813-818. \[[UNC

    -   The titles of these two articles by Kalbach tell you what
        they're about. The *JASIST* article is more scholarly; the
        *interactions* article is intended for an audience of
        interface designers.
-   Mathwick, C., & Rigdon, E. (2004). Play, flow, and the online
    search experience. *Journal of Consumer Research, 31*(2), 324-332.
    \[[UNC libraries, via
    JSTOR](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/422111)\]
    -   Research on consumers also is interested in their affective
        reactions to Web interactions, including searching. This article
        sees "play" as the link between flow theory and the online
        consumer attitude formation process.
-   Kari, J., & Hartel, J. (2007). Information and higher things in
    life: Addressing the pleasurable and the profound in
    information science. *Journal of the American Society for
    Information Science & Technology, 58*(8), 1131-1147. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://eresources.lib.unc.edu/external_db/external_database_auth.html?A=P|F=N|ID=24|REL=AAL|URL=http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20585)\]
    -   The authors argue that information behavior research primarily
        focuses on "lower things" (i.e., everyday, quotidian things),
        and might profit from research on "higher things". Some example
        of higher things are those that are pleasurable (e.g., beauty,
        hobbies, fun, wealth) or profound (e.g., altruism, creativity,
        spirituality and religion, virtues).
-   Lottridge, D., & Moore, G. (2009). Designing for human emotion: Ways
    of knowing. *New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia,
    15*(2), 147-172. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://eresources.lib.unc.edu/external_db/external_database_auth.html?A=P|F=N|ID=24|REL=AAL|URL=http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13614560903165136)\]
    -   Interest in people's emotions as they interact with
        tools/technologies is now of interest in a number of fields --
        computer science, psychiatry/psychology, language and
        literature, information science, market research, and industrial
        design -- all related to computer-human interaction. This
        article analyzes 7 papers from these fields, in terms of
        researcher motivation, conceptualization and operationalization
        of "emotion", the knowledge claims made, and the assumptions
        underlying the research.
-   Klemmer, S.R., Hartman, B., & Takayama, L. (2006). How bodies
    matter: Five themes for interaction design. *Proceedings of the 6th
    Conference on Designing Interactive Systems*, 140-149. \[[UNC
    libraries, via ACM Digital
    Library](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://eresources.lib.unc.edu/external_db/external_database_auth.html?A=P|F=N|ID=24|REL=AAL|URL=http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1142405.1142429)\]
    -   As the title indicates, this paper discusses five themes
        (thinking through doing, performance, visibility, risk, and
        thick practice) that are important for interaction design. They
        demonstrate the central role our bodies play during interactions
        with information tools.

INFORMATION NEEDS

    interests of a user-centered approach to information seeking
    and use. *Information Processing & Management, 29*(1), 13-28. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4573(93)90020-E)\]
    -   Savolainen's earlier explanation of Dervin's theory provides
        both a brief overview (pages 15-18) and a critique of
        the theory.

    -   If you want to hear about Sense-Making Theory and Methodology
        from its originator, try this article. It provides a
        brief overview.

    & Atkin, C.K. (eds.), *Public Communication Campaigns.* Thousand
    Oaks, CA: Sage, 69-87. \[Davis Library - HM1226 .P83 2001\]
    -   This chapter provides more details about Sense-Making Theory and
        how it might be used to shape a communication study
        and campaign.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4573(97)00028-9)\]
    -   Wilson also proposes a comprehensive model of the information
        needs-seeking-use process, adding some psychological components
        that other models do not have.
-   Allen, B. (1997). Information needs: A person-in-situation approach.

    Graham, 111-122. \[SILS Library - Z674.2 .I558 1996\]
    -   Allen's model of information behaviors emphasizes the individual
        situation in which an information need is experienced (similar
        to Dervin's model), and also includes some additional contextual
        dimensions of interest.
-   Savolainen, R. (2013). Approaching the motivators for information

    -   As someone experiences an information need, there is still the
        question of whether they will act to address that need. Here,
        Savolainen examines attribution theory and how it might be
        applied to understanding information seekers' motivations.

    -   Based on a synthesis of 48 studies, published between 1997 and

    -   This classic article in social network theory argues that it's
        our weak ties in our social networks that are likely to provide
        us with novel information. Our strong ties tend to know the same
        things we know, and so are unlikely to bring us new ideas.\

    -   In this study, the authors propose a layered model of trust
        (general propensity to trust influences trust in the medium,
        which influences source trust, which influences trust in

        participants were likely to have too little trust in Wikipedia,
        rather than too much.

    -   In this editorial, Goulding argues that efforts to overcome
        information poverty have resulted in information overload. Both
        the information poor and those overloaded with information are
        unable to take action, either because they do not have the
        available information or because they cannot create order from
        all the information washing over them.

THE IMPACT OF CONTEXT ON INFORMATION SEEKING AND USE
----------------------------------------------------

### **<span id="session16"></span><span id="session17"></span>**16-17:Domain, disciplinary, and organizational context

This first set of articles provide general discussions of the effect of
context on information behaviors.

-   Yu, L. (2012). Towards a reconceptualizatin of 'the information
    worlds of individuals'. *Journal of Librarianship and Information
    Science, 44*(1), 3-18. \[[UNC
    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0961000611424586)\]
    -   While this article focuses on a wider array of types of context
        than just disciplinary context, the author also directly
        compares this analysis with that of Taylor's information use
        environments, as well as Chatman's 'small
        world' conceptualization.

    -   This review summarizes much of the literature examining the
        context of information behaviors and the effects of context on
        those information behaviors. You can quickly skim the first
        three pages because we've covered them in class; begin reading
        on page 276.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2006.08.011)\]
    -   In this study, context was defined as "all those things which
        are not an inherent part of information phenomena, but which
        nevertheless bear some relation to these." The goal of the study
        was to develop a typology of associations between context and
        information behaviors.

    -   This paper discusses the differences between objectified and
        interpretative approaches to understanding context. The first
        approach sees information needs and seeking as patterns of
        behaviors; the second sees them as phenomena mediated by social
        and cultural meanings.

    -   Focus your attention on pages 1729-1734; they review the
        literature on context.

This next set of readings focuses on disciplinary and/or domain
differences and their effects on information behaviors.

    <http://www.oclc.org/research/publications/library/2009/2009-02.pdf>.
    -   This extensive literature review examines a number of facets of
        scholarly information behaviors, including searching, collecting
        materials, reading, writine, collaborating, and several other
        information use practices.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2009.02.002)\]
    -   A survey of faculty in 7 universities in the US and Australia
        found that academic discipline affects their amount of reading,
        format of reading, and time spent reading (across
        medical/helath, engineering/technology, sciences, social
        sciences, and humanities disciplines). Work responsibilities,
        age, productivity of the reader, and purpose for reading also
        affected reading behaviors.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2006.12.010)\]
    -   This study focuses on collaborative information behaviors, and
        takes into account specific aspects of the context of the two
        healthcare teams studied: urban vs. rural hospital, teaching vs.
        non-teaching hospital, intensive care unit vs.
        emergency department).

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00012531311313961)\]
    -   The findings indicate that, not only are there disciplinary
        differences in information seeking, there are also differences
        across sub-disciplines of astronomy/astrophysics.

This third set of articles focuses on the effects of organizational
context on information behaviors.

-   Choo, C.W. (2007). Information seeking in organizations: Epistemic
    contexts and contests. *Information Research, 12*(2).
    <http://informationr.net/ir/12-2/paper298.html>.
    -   By comparing information behaviors in several different types of
        organizations (a government agency, a venture capital firm, a
        bank, and an office products company), Choo identifies aspects
        of those organizational cultures that affect the information
        behaviors of workers.
-   Lamb, R., King, J.L., & Kling, R. (2003). Informational
    environments: Organizational contexts of online information use.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.10182)\]
    -   This study works with organizations as the unit of analysis, and
        examines their environments (i.e., contexts) and how aspects of
        those environments affect their use of online
        information services. Firms in three industries are studied:
        law, real estate, and biotech/pharmaceuticals.
-   Baldwin, N.S., & Rice, R.E. (1997). Information-seeking behavior of

    -   The focus here is on the context provided by individual
        characteristics and institutional resources. They were found to
        influence the information sources and communication channels
        used by securities analysts, and those sources/channels were
        found to influence the outcomes of their work.

This final set of articles considers a variety of other types of
contextual influences on information behaviors.

-   Savolainen, R. (2012). Conceptualizing information need in context.
    *Information Research, 17*(4), Paper 534.
    <http://InformationR.net/ir/17-4/paper534.html>.
    -   Based on a literature review, Savolainen identifies three ways
        in which context is understood in relation to information needs:
        situations of action as context, task performance as context,
        and dialogue as context.

    -   This study examines the effects of variations in three regional
        HIV/AIDS service agencies in Canada. They varied in their
        service models, resource munificence and technology use, and
        levels of interpersonal interaction, among
        other characteristics.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.21513)\]
    -   This study takes into account aspects of the task motivating the
        search (importance, complexity, urgency), characteristics of the
        searcher (task self-efficacy, learning orientation) and the
        environment (learning environment), and aspects of the
        information source being used (quality, access difficulty, and
        communication difficulty). The effects of these context
        variables on source use were studied among working professionals
        in Singapore.

    -   This paper imagines a future in which a physical or digital
        library might be designed to provide context-aware services,
        based on recognizing each user as he/she enters.

        interactionism, and exchange) to assess their potential utility
        for understanding everyday life information behavior and
        technology use.

    -   This study examined the use of Flickr by amateur photographers
        who considered their hobby as a 'serious leisure' pursuit. It
        can be argued that information needs associated with serious
        leisure activities are different from both more casual everyday
        information nees and work-related information needs. This is an
        area of growing research interest.

    -   Dill and Janke analyze the film, The Big Lebowski, in much the
        same way you're being asked to analyze an information seeking
        episode from your own experience. They use a variet of the
        models we discuss in class to analyze the information seeking
        and sense making of four of the film's characters.

### **<span id="session20"></span>**20: Collaborative search and delegated/imposed queries

This first set of papers focuses on academic settings where an
information need is delegated or imposed by someone other than the
information seeker.

    -   This article applies Gross's ideas about imposed queries to the
        process of responding to reference questions; she provides
        explicit advice for reference librarians.

    -   Students were assigned to use a chat-based reference service.
        The librarians responding to these queries noticed several
        differences between responding to these quesitons and responding
        to self-generated chat queries, particularly in the assistance
        that they were expected to provide to the students in selecting
        their paper topics.

This second set of papers are similar, but the delegation occurred in a
non-academic setting.

    -   Even though most people need help with their home computers,
        they tend to delegate the seeking of technical assistance to the
        most technically-competent family member (who plays the role of
        the family guru). The key benefits from this role are discussed.

    -   This choice for our reading may seem far-fetched, but the issue
        of disintermediation has come up in a variety of industries,
        including the travel industry. This study explores
        travel-related information seeking as a choice between two
        information sources (travel agents vs. service providers) and as
        a choice between two information channels (face to face vs.
        the internet).

    -   Jansen designed a middleware application that would provide
        automated assistance at the points in the search interaction
        when the user was most likely to be receptive to such
        an intervention. The application and the results from using it
        are briefly described in this article. A more detailed

    -   People often need help when searching a digital collection (and
        sometimes even seek help). This study identified 15 different
        types of help-seeking situations that searchers of a digital
        library reported.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.22680)\]
    -   The title pretty much says it all. They found two dimensions on
        which the different types of networks varied: citation-based
        versus noncitation-based, and social versus cognitive.

    -   Using citations to the work of 25 ILS faculty members as a case
        study, the authors examine the effects of using Scopus and
        Google Scholar on the citation counts and rankings of scholars
        as measured by Web of Science. This is a fairly long article;
        focus your attention on pages 2107-2108, skim the methods
        section, study the results and discussion in more detail.

    <http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001675>.
    -   Three methods of assessing the merit of a scientific paper were
        compared: subjective post-publication peer review, the number of
        citations to the paper, and the impact factor of the paper in
        which the article was published.

    -   The weaknesses of the "impact factor" of a journal are
        often discussed. This article describes the use of social
        network centrality metrics as an alternative measure of
        scholarly impact.

    -   Popularity is defined as the number of times an author is cited
        and prestige is defined as the number of times an author is
        cited by highly cited papers. Using information retrieval as a
        test field, 40 reseachers were compared in terms of their
        popularity and prestige over time.

    -   An examination of citations to the work of 75 award-winning
        researchers indicates that they have a rather large fraction
        (10% or more) of uncited publications, i.e., at least 10% of
        their publications have never been cited.
-   Smith, A.G. (2004). Web links as analogues of citations.

    -   Web links were classified in terms of the reasons for linking.
        Approximately 20% of the links could be regarded as research
        links analogous to citations.

    libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.10338)\]
    -   The character and source of Web links to journal articles in
        information and library science were analyzed. They correlated
        with bibliographic citations and tended to represent
        intellectual impact, and came from papers posted on the
        Web (30%) or from class reading lists (12%).

    13*(4), e123. <http://www.jmir.org/2011/4/e123/>.
    -   Tweets citing JMIR articles were analyzed, and then compared
        with citations to those articles 17-29 months later. There was a
        high correlation between "tweetations" and citations, so the
        author concludes that "tweets can predict highly cited articles
        within the first 3 days of article publication."

    -   This study examines the impact of scholars' websites, rather
        than their individual publications. "The findings suggest that
        universities with higher rated scholars produce significantly
        more Web content but with a similar average online impact."

    -   "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his or her *N* papers have
        at least *h* citations each and the other (*N - h*) papers have
        fewer than *h* citations each." Thus, the h index is based on
        both the number of publications and the number of citations
        to them. This article examines the validity of the *h* index, in
        terms of its relationship to peer assessments.

    -   This study analyzes 295 chemistry blog posts about
        peer-reviewed research. The authors conclude that scientific
        discourse on the Web is more immediate, contextually relevant
        and has a larger non-technical focus than the

    -   The authors see three "breaking points" in the current scholarly
        publishing system: its business model, its system of peer
        review, and its system of post-publication evaluation (i.e.,
        citations as impact). They suggest various ways in which the
        system might be transformed.

    -   This study examined the phenomenon of news coverage of results
        reported at scientific meetings. Because those reports are based
        on brief presentations and abstracts only, the underlying
        scholarly work has not undergone rigorous peer review,

    -   The authors analyzed 1808 citations to YouTube videos within
        scholarly publications from 2006 to 2011. There were
        disciplinary differences; for example, videos cited in science
        articles had scientific-related content, videos cited in the
        arts and humanities had art, culture, or history themes, and
        videos cited in the social sciences tended to be related to
        news, politics, advertisements, and documentaries.

    -   The authors surveyed 429 authors who recently published articles
        in OA journals with article processing charges (APCs). Fit,
        quality, and speed of publication were the most important
        factors in the authors' selection of a journal, but the fact
        that it was open access also played a role in that decision.
        There were differences in the sources of funding for APCs
        by discipline.

        examine authors' adoption of hybrid OA. Of traditional journals
        that offer authors the option to free their individual articles
        from access barriers by paying an article processing fee, only
        1-2% have used that option, even though there are twice as many
        journals offering the option now, compared to a few years ago.

    -   In this book, Borgman describes the current work of scholarship,
        in which scholars and scientists have access to a huge amount of
        data collected unobtrusively through digital devices embedded in
        the environment. Thus, the data collected (as well as the amount
        of literature published) can also lead to information overload.

    -   Building on Levy's argument that scholars need more time to
        think and reflect, Anderson argues that working through
        uncertainty and ambiguity is conducive to scholarly creativity.
        Information system designers should focus on minimizing the time

    -   In the past, librarians have become adept at helping their
        patrons to find large numbers of publications; in the future,
        they'll need to help their patrons focus their searches on the
