      <li>As you read the assigned Marchionini article, you may have noticed that he referenced this article. In it, Buckland examines three meanings of information: information as process, information as knowledge, and information as thing. He argues that the field of information and library science should be particular interested in information as thing. Also, if you've heard references to antelopes as information objects, this is the source.</li>

          <li>Meadow and Yuan have been frustrated by the many different definitions of information used in the field of information science. They begin with the classic Shannon and Weaver model of the flow of information from an information source to a receiver, and then provide an overview of the definitions used along the continuum from data to information to knowledge.</li>

      <li>This is a typical study of information seeking/searching, with its focus on the cognitive aspects of the process. This perspective in many studies of students, partly because the searching activities are associated with school assignments.

      <li>This choice for our reading may seem far-fetched, but the issue of disintermediation has come up in a variety of industries, including the travel industry. This study explores travel-related information seeking as a choice between two information sources (travel agents vs. service providers) and as a choice between two information channels (face to face vs. the internet).</li>

      <li>In this book, Borgman describes the current work of scholarship, in which scholars and scientists have access to a huge amount of data collected unobtrusively through digital devices embedded in the environment. Thus, the data collected (as well as the amount of literature published) can also lead to information overload.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Saracevic provides his own &quot;personal analysis&quot; of the field of information science (note: more broadly defined than the scope of this particular course), with special emphasis on its origins, the central role of problems in information retrieval, and the relationship between information science and librarianship.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>As you read the assigned Marchionini article, you may have noticed that he referenced this article. In it, Buckland examines three meanings of information: information as process, information as knowledge, and information as thing. He argues that the field of information and library science should be particular interested in information as thing. Also, if you've heard references to antelopes as information objects, this is the source.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Meadow and Yuan have been frustrated by the many different definitions of information used in the field of information science. They begin with the classic Shannon and Weaver model of the flow of information from an information source to a receiver, and then provide an overview of the definitions used along the continuum from data to information to knowledge.</li>

      <li>This is a typical study of information seeking/searching, with its focus on the cognitive aspects of the process. This perspective in many studies of students, partly because the searching activities are associated with school assignments. There are many other studies that you might also look at, as examples, but this is one that is well-designed and well-executed.</li>

      <li>Over multiple sessions, novice searchers conducted searches of a full-text magazine database. Some of the cognitive behaviors of interest were the actual uses of the information retrieved.

      <li>This choice for our reading may seem far-fetched, but the issue of disintermediation has come up in a variety of industries, including the travel industry. This study explores travel-related information seeking as a choice between two information sources (travel agents vs. service providers) and as a choice between two information channels (face to face vs. the internet).</li>

      <li>In this book, Borgman describes the current work of scholarship, in which scholars and scientists have access to a huge amount of data collected unobtrusively through digital devices embedded in the environment. Thus, the data collected (as well as the amount of literature published) can also lead to information overload.</li>

      <li>In this article, Bj&ouml;rk uses a portion of the same data set to examine authors' adoption of hybrid OA. Of traditional journals that offer authors the option to free their individual articles from access barriers by paying an article processing fee, only 1-2% have used that option, even though there are twice as many journals offering the option  now, compared to a few years ago.</li>

      <li>Over 4000 UK scholars responded to a survey about scholarly publishing. This paper reports on their responses to some of the open-ended questions (the full report of the results is a required reading for this session). Concerns they raised include: the peer-review system, copyright, journal prices, alternative business   models for journal publishing, big deals, Elsevier, electronic   publishing and digital journals. </li>

    <ul>
      <li>In this book, Borgman describes the current work of scholarship, in which scholars and scientists have access to a huge amount of data collected unobtrusively through digital devices embedded in the environment. Thus, the data collected (as well as the amount of literature published) can also lead to information overload.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Building on Levy's argument that scholars need more time to think and reflect, Anderson argues that working through uncertainty and ambiguity is conducive to scholarly creativity. Information system designers should focus on minimizing the time needed to manage information so that more time is available for creative activity.</li>

      <li>In the past, librarians have become adept at helping their patrons to find large numbers of publications; in the future, they'll need to help their patrons focus their searches on the most essential documents.
