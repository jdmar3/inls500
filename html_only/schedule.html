	<h2>Introduction and Basic Concepts</h2>

		<h3>Wednesday, August 19 (session #1): Trends in human information interaction research</h3>
			<p class="instruction">These two brief articles were written as part of the 10th anniversary celebration (in 2009) of the Special Interest Group on Information Needs, Seeking, and Use of the American Society for Information Science &amp; Technology. Together, they provide a brief historical overview of the general directions taken in information behavior research.</p>

			  <p class="annotation">In this article, Bates discusses the &quot;below-the-water-line&quot; portion of information science. While she focuses more of her attention on the content/information of concern, she does include human-information interactions among her &quot;Three Big Questions&quot; in information science. Read through this article quickly, to get an overview of the field as background for the semester.</p>

			<p class="article">Dinet, J., Chevalier, A., &amp; Tricot, A. (2012). Information search activity: An overview. <em>Revue europ&eacute;ene de psychologie appliqu&eacute;, 62</em>(2)<em>, </em>49-62. (Read sections 2.1-2.2.1.)

				<p class="annotation">A number of models of information seeking are briefly reviewed here. Of particular interest are those described in sections 2.1-2.2.1 (as background for understanding the Ingwersen and J&auml;rvelin model.) </p>
			<p class="article">Ingwersen, P., &amp; J&auml;rvelin, K. (2005). <em>The Turn: Integration of Information Seeking and Retrieval in Context.</em>Springer.

				<p class="annotation">Section 6.1, Building the conceptual framework, p. 263-274.  This section of this important book walks through the model that the authors are proposing. They believe that the model encompassses all of the information behaviors of interest to our field. The cognitive aspects of those information behaviors are at center stage. (Feel free to skim other parts of chapter 6 if you have time.) </p>

		<h3>Monday, August 31 (session #4): Affective approaches</h3>

The 'information search process' revisited: Is the model still useful? <em>Information Research, 13</em>(4), Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Information Seeking in Context, Vilnius, September 2008). <a href="http://informationr.net/ir/13-4/paper355.html">http://informationr.net/ir/13-4/paper355.html</a>. </p>
				<p class="annotation">Kuhlthau's model of the information search process is well-known and widely-used to understand the process that people go through while searching for information. It includes their cognitive behaviors (such a learning) as well as their feelings and how they vary throughout the process. The model itself is summarized in Figure 1; to read the original work on it, see the two Kuhlthau articles listed as optional reading, plus her book. </p>

[<a href="http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2010.09.001">UNC libraries</a>] </p>
				<p class="annotation">This literature review provides a strong foundation for moving forward with research about emotions and their relationships with information behaviors. Focus your reading on sections 2 and 4.1. The first and last sections are overviews, so will help you put the detail into context. Skim section 3, just to get a sense of what methods have been used in studies of emotions. </p>

			<p class="article">Taylor, R.S. (1968). Question negotiation and  information seeking in libraries. <em>College  &amp; Research Libraries, 29</em>(3),178-194. (Read about the four levels of &quot;questions,&quot; on pages 182-183; we'll come back to the rest in a few weeks.) <span class="amcc">[WILL ADD TO SAKAI]</span> </p>
				<p class="annotation">This is a classic reading, so you'll want to eventually study it all. For now, we want to focus our attention on Taylor's explanation of visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs. </p>

				<p class="annotation">Brenda Dervin has proposed a Sense-Making Theory to explain how people experience information needs and act on them. In this article, Savolainen focuses on gaps (i.e., information needs). One of Dervin's articles on this theory and an additional article on it by Savolainen are listed among the optional readings for today. </p>

		<h3>Monday, September 7:  NO CLASS. Labor Day holiday</h3>
		
		<h3>Wednesday, September 9 (session #6): Expressing information needs</h3>
			
			<p class="article">Belkin, N. (1980). Anomalous states of knowledge as a  basis for information retrieval. <em>Canadian  Journal of Information Science, 5</em>,133-143.  <span class="amcc">[WILL ADD TO SAKAI]</span> </p>
				<p class="annotation">This, along with his 1982 <em>Journal of Documentation</em> article with Oddy and Brooks, are the classic works explaining this concept. It's a relatively straightforward concept; I'd like you to pay special attention to his explanation of the specifiability of an information need, p136-139, with Figure 3.   </p>
			<p class="article">Sparck-Jones, K., Robertson, S.E., &amp; Sanderson, M. (2007). Ambiguous requests: Implications for retrieval tests, systems and theories<em>. ACM SIGIR Forum, 41</em>(2), 8-17.

				<p class="annotation">The literature on expressing information needs covers a broad range of questions and domains. This article focuses on a particular situation: a computer user trying to request help in using a computer. The authors were particularly interested in developing a &quot;script&quot; that the user would fill out, in order to provide complete and accurate information to the expert/helper, but we'll focus our discussion on the more conceptual aspects of this problem, described in the first few sections of the article. </p>
			<p class="article">Bates, M.E. (1998). Finding the question behind the question. <em>Information Outlook, 2</em>(7), 19-21. <span class="amcc">[WILL ADD TO SAKAI]</span> </p>
				<p class="annotation">For some very practical advice about helping library users to express their information needs, check out this article. I believe that you'll find this advice reminiscent of Taylor's 1968 suggestions for filtering the questions received at the library reference desk. </p>

Once useful resources are discovered, the scholar assembles them into thematic research collections and uses those collections to create new knowledge.

				<p class="annotation">The evaluation of scholarly productivity with citation (i.e., bibliometric) data is often called scientometrics. In this paper, the authors describe and discuss several alternative metrics (based on social bookmarking or microblogging) that could provide a more complete picture of a scholar's impact.    </p>

				<p class="annotation">Data on citations to the computer science literature were collected through CiteSeer and through Web of Science (then, SCISEARCH).

				<p class="annotation">Updates his earlier work with Kate McCain, visualizing information science. He briefly reviews the methods used in the previous work, but focuses on introducing the advantages of a new approach to cocitation analysis: Pathfinder networks. Focus your reading on two sections: &quot;ACA Mapping&quot; and &quot;PFNETs and Their Advantages.&quot; Also study the figures, and skim the text around them in enough depth to get a basic understanding of what the figures mean.  </p>

This is an overview chapter and introduces most of the basic concepts of diffusion theory. Also examine Figure 5-1 on page 163; it provides an overview of the stages of the innovation decision process.

				<p class="annotation">Bush's Memex was intended to address the problem of information overload. With the increasing pace of scholarly publication, this problem has only gottten worse. Levy argues that, in addition to developing better information management tools, we also need to create space and time for thinking and reflection. In this version of this paper, he comments on the role of digital libraries; in his journal article on the same theme, he goes into more depth on other facets of his argument.
