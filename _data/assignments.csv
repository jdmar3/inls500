observation,Observation and analysis,Observation and analysis,Understanding the information seeking research process ,"In this assignment, you will work with a partner to each observe an exploratory search event. Each of you will conduct an exploratory search for the topic you have selected for your system/service proposal assignment that we will start in a few weeks. You will use the think-aloud protocol to observe your partner's search. <br/><br/>You will take notes on your partner's actions and their narrative description of what they are thinking and feeling during their search. Then you will then analyze their behaviors using your notes and connect it to the theoretical literature we have been reading and discussing in class. ",,"Grades for the final deliverable of this assignment are based on the depth of your <i>analysis</i> of the experience you observed. You will need: a description of the information need, the motivations behind the search, obstacles experienced, sources used, tasks performed, and the results obtained from the searches. A large part of your grade will be based on demonstrating your ability to apply multiple concepts, theories, and models, as well as to use the terminology covered in the course. Your notes and description will be attached as an appendix, so you should not spend much space in the analysis retelling the narrative of the search event. You will use APA style and include citations to the literature where appropriate. ",20,main,,40,

In the case that we have an odd number of people in the class, we will have one group of three.</li><li>Choose a topic for your system/service proposal (see below for description of the goals for that assignment). You will not be locked into this, but keep in mind that this is an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone and get your exploratory search out of the way. This topic should be somewhat specific: think about a group of people with a specific information problem. This is your topic for exploratory search.</li><li>Choose a date for your data collection event. The exploratory search should take between 30-45 minutes for each partner. You may want to record the think-aloud or use screen capture software so that you can refer to it later.

Your data consistes of: detailed notes on your partner's behavior and think-aloud narrative, possibly a timeline, summary, any recordings you might create, and anything else that you might want to collect to help you contextualize your observation.

observation,Observation and analysis,Analysis,"Using relevant literature, write an analysis from your collected data","Analyze the exploratory search that you observed. Consider which, if any, of the information seeking and use models we have discussed in class apply to your partner's situation. Think about your partner's motivations, information seeking process, how they used and handled the information they were finding. Think about cognitive and affective aspects of their experience.<br/><br/>Write a brief report (3-4 single-spaced pages, approx. 1500 words). Interpret the observed experience. Focus on applying the models and theories discussed in class instead of the narrative description of the event. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that you can use the terminology and apply concepts, theory, and models we are discussing in class to analyze and understand observable information behaviors. Cite literature from class in your report appropriately.<br/><br/>Consider these questions:<ul><li>What search strategies did your partner use? Did they work? How did they deal with successful and failed strategies?</li><li>What information behaviors did your partner exhibit during their search?</li><li>Where did your partner search? What resources did they consult? Why?</li><li>What barriers or surprises did they encounter while searching?</li><li>Was the exploratory search successful or unsuccessful? How do ou decide what what makes an exploratory search successful or not?</li></ul>",Expository/Analytical writing,,,fin,1,20,2016-10-12
