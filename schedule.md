### <span id="session1"></span>\#1: Trends in human information interaction research

These two brief articles were written as part of the 10th anniversary celebration (in 2009) of the Special Interest Group on Information Needs, Seeking, and Use of the American Society for Information Science & Technology. 
Together, they provide a brief historical overview of the general directions taken in information behavior research.

### <span id="session2"></span>\#2: Theoretical perspectives and basic concepts

In class: sign-up for day to present [Evidence Summary](/assignments/#evidencesummary)

Each of these two readings takes a slightly different view of our field
and, in particular, the portion of our field surveyed in this course.

Bates, M. J. (1999). The invisible substrate of information science.
*Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 50*(12),
1043-1050. \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1999)50:12<1043::AID-ASI1>3.0.CO;2-X)\]

In this article, Bates discusses the "below-the-water-line" portion of information science. 
While she focuses more of her attention on the content/information of concern, she does include human-information interactions among her "Three Big Questions" in information science.
Read through this article quickly, to get an overview of the field as background for the semester.

Marchionini, G. (2008). Human-information interaction. *Library & Information Science Research, 30*(3), 165-174. \[[UNC libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2008.07.001)\]

Marchionini focuses more directly on the scope of this course. Read through the entire article, but focus special attention on sections 2 and 6.

### <span id="session1"></span>\#3 Cognitive approaches to information behaviors

Due: Title of article for [Evidence Summary](/assignments/#evidencesummary)

Dinet, J., Chevalier, A., & Tricot, A. (2012). Information search
activity: An overview. *Revue européene de psychologie appliqué,
62*(2)*,* 49-62. (Read sections 2.1-2.2.1.) \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erap.2012.03.004)\]

A number of models of information seeking are briefly reviewed here. Of
particular interest are those described in sections 2.1-2.2.1 (as
background for understanding the Ingwersen and Järvelin model.)

Ingwersen, P., & Järvelin, K. (2005). *The Turn: Integration of
Information Seeking and Retrieval in Context.*Springer. \[[UNC libraries
- electronic
resource](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/10.1007/1-4020-3851-8)\]

Section 6.1, Building the conceptual framework, p. 263-274. This section
of this important book walks through the model that the authors are
proposing. They believe that the model encompassses all of the
information behaviors of interest to our field. The cognitive aspects of
those information behaviors are at center stage. (Feel free to skim
other parts of chapter 6 if you have time.)

### \#4: Affective approaches

Kuhlthau, C., Heinström, J., & Todd, R.J. (2008). The 'information
search process' revisited: Is the model still useful? *Information
Research, 13*(4), Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Information
Seeking in Context, Vilnius, September 2008).
<http://informationr.net/ir/13-4/paper355.html>.

Kuhlthau's model of the information search process is well-known and
widely-used to understand the process that people go through while
searching for information. It includes their cognitive behaviors (such a
learning) as well as their feelings and how they vary throughout the
process. The model itself is summarized in Figure 1; to read the
original work on it, see the two Kuhlthau articles listed as optional
reading, plus her book.

Lopatovska, I., & Arapakis, I. (2011). Theories, methods and current
research on emotions in library and information science, information
retrieval and human-computer interaction. *Information Processing &
Management, 47*(4), 575-592. \[[UNC
libraries](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2010.09.001)\]

This literature review provides a strong foundation for moving forward
with research about emotions and their relationships with information
behaviors. Focus your reading on sections 2 and 4.1. The first and last
sections are overviews, so will help you put the detail into context.
Skim section 3, just to get a sense of what methods have been used in
studies of emotions.
