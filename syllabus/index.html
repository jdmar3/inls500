<p><span class='newthought'>INLS 500 is a course that surveys human information interactions</span>  through broad examination of information science literature. 
Students examine cognitive, social, organizational/institutional, and behavioral approaches to understanding interactions between people and information.
Emphasis is placed on the role of the information professional or information scientist as mediator, and students are encouraged to apply analyze current events and situations.</p>

<p>This course undergirds much of the SILS curriculum because it introduces students to core concepts that have implications for the practice of information science and librarianship. 
It is expected that it will be taken during the first or second semester of the student&#39;s career at SILS.</p>

<h1 id="readings">Readings</h1>

<p>This is a survey course, which means that it is very reading-intensive.
There will be something to read for each session. 
Students are expected to complete readings in preparation for each class meeting. </p>

<p>Most readings will be available either on the open web or through the univerity&#39;s proxy. Any that are not will be made available in Sakai. </p>

<p>No textbook is required.</p>

<h2 id="session-notes">Session Notes</h2>

<p>Pay attention to the <a href="http://inls500.johndmart.in/schedule/">schedule</a>. 
Session notes will be posted prior to each class and you would do well to look over them before coming to class. </p>

<p>These are, however, not a substitute for lectures, discussions, or any other in-class activity.
They are meant to provide an overview and summary of the readings and concepts discussed in class.</p>

<p>Readings for the upcoming session will be included on the previous session&#39;s notes. </p>

<h1 id="lectures">Lectures</h1>

<p>What follows is a typical plan. 
All sessions will not look like this, but many will.</p>

<p>Our sessions for this course are 75 minutes long. </p>

<p>The first ~5 minutes will be reviewing the material from the previous session. 
This will be mostly done by you. 
You will talk about what you learned and I will listen.</p>

<p>The next 30 to 40 minutes will consist of lecture (a fair amount); whole-group discussion (a lot).</p>

<p>20 to 30 minutes will be devoted to an active learning exercise, typically performed in small groups. 
These exercises will reinforce conceptual material, or be directed at helping to work through part of an assignment or practical skill required for the course.</p>

<p>The last 10 minutes will be reserved for conceptual wrap-up and questions regarding assignments, future readings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="session-notes">Session Notes</h2>

<p>Class sessions will have online lecture notes (which will include links to supplementary readings). </p>

<p>Some lecture notes will be very detailed and loaded with images and text; some lecture notes will be spare and loaded with hyperlinks (recognize that links may change over time).</p>

<p>Refer to the lecture notes either to prepare for what you are going to learn or to review what you have learned.
Lecture notes will be made available just before each class session. 
See the <a href="http://inls500.johndmart.in/schedule/">schedule</a> for links to lecture notes. </p>

<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>

<p>This class has no exams, but there are several major tasks that will correspond to one of the major objectives in the course. </p>

<p>All of the tasks are interconnected, so it is important to complete the tasks in succession by the due dates listed in the chart below. </p>

<h2 id="assignment-tasks">Assignment Tasks</h2>

<p>See <a href="http://inls500.johndmart.in/assignments/">this page</a> for a list of assignments and links to individual assignment instructions. </p>

</thead><tbody>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="due-dates">Due Dates</h2>

<p>Each task is due by the end of the day (midnight) on the date specified. 
It would be a good idea to complete assignments before that deadline so that you can get a jump on the next section. 
The final assignment will be due before the final exam day, but will be presented during the exam day session itself. You will have one chance to make changes after submission. </p>

<h2 id="submitting-assignments">Submitting Assignments</h2>

<p>All of your assignments will be submitted using the assignments feature in Sakai.</p>

<p>All written assignments will be uploaded in PDF format. 
DOCX or other formats will not be accepted.</p>

<p>You will use the following format in uploading your files:</p>

<p><code>SURNAME-REVERSE_ORDER_DATE-ASSIGNMENT_NUMBER-ASSIGNMENT_PART-SHORT_DESCRIPTION.FILE_EXTENSION</code></p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p><code>Martin-20160830-Assignment1-Part2-Analysis_final.pdf</code></p>

<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>In addition to the 6 tasks, participation will be evaluated and included in the evaluation scheme. 
Participation, of course, means coming to class: that is mandatory. 
It also means bringing something to the class by way of discussion or links shared with the rest of the class. 
Since we are a small class this summer, we will decide on the first day how best to accomplish the sharing of resources. </p>

<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>

<p>Attendance is mandatory. Absence will affect your grade in the class. There is no way to make up for this.</p>

<h2 id="grades-and-progress">Grades and Progress</h2>

<p>We will use the standard UNC grading scale for this course. 
Assignment tasks are rubricated and points will be assigned by the instructor after the completion of each task. 
Rubrics are not published, but are based on the assignment descriptions. </p>

<p>Grades will be made available on a rolling basis.</p>

<h1 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h1>

<h2 id="what-it-means-to-us">What it means to us</h2>

<p>Instructors and students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill adhere to the Code of Student Conduct. 
Accordingly, you all should recognize that most software applications available in the computer lab are copyrighted and cannot be copied.
We will primarily use open source software for this course, which does allow for copying. 
It is important to know the difference and heed the terms of software licences. </p>

<p>We can learn much from each other and we will do that. 
I expect each of you to help each other.
We&#39;ll discuss what we expect in terms of cooperative, collaborative, shared work and the honor code.</p>

<h2 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h2>

<p>It shall be the responsibility of every student at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to obey and support the enforcement of the <a href="http://studentconduct.unc.edu/">Honor Code</a>, which prohibits lying, cheating, or stealing when these actions involve academic processes or University, student or academic personnel acting in an official capacity.</p>

<h2 id="campus-code">Campus Code</h2>

<p>It shall be the further responsibility of every student to abide by the <a href="http://studentconduct.unc.edu/honor-system/philosophy">philosophy of the code</a>; namely, to conduct oneself so as not to impair significantly the welfare or the educational opportunities of others in the University community.</p>

<h2 id="instructor-responsibilities">Instructor Responsibilities</h2>

<p>I have a role to play as well, and I will fulfill <a href="http://studentconduct.unc.edu/instructors">these responsibilities</a>.</p>

<p>The system rests on several central tenets:</p>

<p>The university community, including faculty and students, share a commitment to the pursuit of truth, and the dissemination of knowledge to succeeding generations of citizens devoted to the high ideals of personal honor and respect for the rights of others.</p>

<p>These goals can only be achieved in a setting in which intellectual honesty and personal integrity are highly valued; other individuals are trusted, respected, and fairly treated; and the responsibility for articulating and maintaining high standards is widely shared.</p>

<p>Both students and faculty must play active roles in fostering a culture in which honor is prized and acting to remedy violations of community norms relating to academic misconduct, injuries to members of the University community, and conduct that adversely affect University operations and resources.</p>

<p>The principles of academic honesty, integrity, and responsible citizenship govern the performance of all academic work and student conduct at the University as they have during the long life of this institution.</p>

<p>Your acceptance of enrollment in the University presupposes a commitment to the principles embodied in the Code of Student Conduct and a respect for the most significant Carolina tradition.</p>

<p>Your reward is in the practice of these principles.</p>

<p><strong>Your participation in this course comes with the expectation that your work will be completed in full observance of the Honor Code.</strong></p>

<p><em>You are encouraged to work together with your fellow students and to share knowledge and learning.</em></p>

<p>However, academic dishonesty in any form is unacceptable, because any breach in academic integrity, however small, strikes destructively at the University&#39;s life and work.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>

<p>In support of the University&#39;s diversity goals and the mission of the School of Information and Library Science, SILS embraces diversity as an ethical and societal value.</p>

<p>We broadly define diversity to include race, gender, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation and physical and learning ability.</p>

<p>As an academic community committed to preparing our graduates to be leaders in an increasingly multicultural and global society we strive to:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Ensure inclusive leadership, policies and practices;</li>
<li>  Integrate diversity into the curriculum and research;</li>
<li>  Foster a mutually respectful intellectual environment in which diverse opinions are valued;</li>
<li>  Recruit traditionally underrepresented groups of students, faculty and staff; and</li>
<li>  Participate in outreach to underserved groups in the State.</li>
</ul>

<p>The statement represents a commitment of resources to the development and maintenance of an academic environment that is open, representative, reflective and committed to the concepts of equity and fairness.</p>

<h2 id="class-conduct-and-expectations">Class conduct and expectations</h2>

<p>This class is not a safe space, but a brave space. 
Here you are encouraged to be your most authentic self, take intellectual chances, make mistakes. 
Our social contract in this class requires that we respect the above guidelines regarding inclusion and expand them to and beyond their boundaries. </p>

<p>People are complex, intersectional beings.
Our identities are fluid and performative. 
It is incumbent upon each of us to remember that, particularly if we come from a place of privilege which allows us to think that everyone has the same advantages and opportunities that we have.</p>

<p>None of us are perfect. 
We all make mistakes. 
But: if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, you can&#39;t make mistakes.
You don&#39;t have any parameters for understanding what is and isn&#39;t a mistake. 
We are learning together and that entails accepting our ignorance and working through it toward something better: knowledge.  </p>

<p>Think, before you speak or act, about how your words and actions affect those around you. 
Symbolic violence is real and can be committed very easily. 
It is usually not recognized as such by those committing it.
Take care that your words and actions are not marginalizing those who find themselves regularly marginalized. 
Instead, use your words to empower and avocate for each other.  </p>
