Today we will return to talking about information seeking, but approach it from a practical perspective. We will discuss and practice how to formulate queries and search strategies for both exploratory search and and more advanced search. 

Look over the following and familiarize yourself with different approaches to understanding search strategies:

We will also look at the models that we did not get to on Tuesday:
