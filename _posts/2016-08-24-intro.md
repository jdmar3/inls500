# Introduction

In class today we will go over the structure and presentation of material for the course and introduce ourselves to one another. 

We will also introduce a few concepts, mostly through discussion. 

We will end with an activity that is meant to help orient us to the class and learn to work through the literature assigned for the course as effciently and effectively as possible.
