Since it is Independence Day, there is no class. I recommend that you watch the film [Independence Day](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/) (1996), and think about how information needs and seeking are portrayed in different parts of the story. 

This piece is also a good study of information seeking in times of disaster:
