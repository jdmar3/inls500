This session is an overview of the place of theory in information science, as well as a conceptual overview of the field.

# The Water Line

Information science is both a basic and applied scientific field at as it is understood explicitly. 
It relates to the study of gathering, organizing, storing, retrieving, and disseminating information (Bates, 1999, p. 1044). 

This is the tip of the iceberg. 
Information science as a field or discipline is far less coherent, which is not a bad thing. 

Information science is really a meta-discipline or meta-field. 
There are many areas of study that can be argued as relevant to the field. 

In addition to this, there is no central methodological orientation in information science research. 
Bates argues that this is related to the "multitalented nature" of the people who tend to be attracted to this field  (1999, p. 1049). 
It is also arguable that there is something intrinsically so complex about the study of information that those engaged in it become multitalented interdisciplinarians. 

# Theory

Theory and theory building feature heavily in the field now. 
We are increasingly concerned with generating theory, rather than borrowing in as a mode for understanding the phenomena we study. 
Given this, it is important to understand what theory is and what it should do. 

Halverson defines four attributes of theory that we should consider when attempting to engage it:

1. descriptive power
2. rhetorical power
3. inferential power
4. application (2002, p. 245)

Halverson also cautions us to question two things about theory:

1. What is a theory predisposed to do? 
2. What do we want it to do? (2002, p. 245)

What do we mean by these things? 

# Values

Information science has largely been understood as a "value neutral" field in the way of other sciences and engineering fields are viewed. 
Librarianship tends to be oriented toward service and empowerment (Bates, 1999, p. 1049)

How are these orientations at odds with one another? 

Do we accept the notion that information science can be value neutral? 
Why or why not? 

We will consider the two news/media stories above in the context of this question.
