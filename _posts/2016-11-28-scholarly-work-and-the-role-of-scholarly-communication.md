Skim or read both of these articles AFTER class today. We will have an open discussion about what the role of scholarly communication is in the academy and society. We will draw on our experience from this semester assembling a body of literature to support further research or action.

I would also like you to watch this [TED Talk by Clay Shirky](https://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government) on the origins of open source (which also discusses the origins of scholarly communication). 
The theme of the talk is on open source government, but the content is entirely relevant to our current topic.
