Today you we will have an informmal presentation and discussion about all of the work that you have done in the course of writing your term paper. 

This will involved a brief (5-10) minute presentation from each member of the class. You may use slides, give a summary handout, draw on the whiteboard, or use whatever other presentation materials or aides you find helpful.
