Today we will go over a number of information behavior models and discuss how they provide a mechanism for explaining and understanding theory. We will also discuss theoretical constructs and variables.

Fidel (2012) lays out several different types of models:

1. Action models
2. Element models
3. Mixed models

Some of the theoretical models we encounter can be thought of as *process models* as well, because they describe a chain of steps in a process, rather than simply the relationships between constructs.
