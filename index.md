Course Description
------------------

INLS 500 is a course that surveys human information interactions through
broad examination of information science literature. Students examine
cognitive, social, organizational/institutional, and behavioral
approaches to understanding interactions between people and information.
Emphasis is placed on the role of the information professional or
information scientist as mediator, and students are encouraged to apply
analyze current events and situations.

This course undergirds much of the SILS curriculum because it introduces
students to core concepts that have implications for the practice of
information science and librarianship. It is expected that it will be
taken during the first or second semester of the student's career at
SILS.

Objectives
----------

Students completing this course will:

-   become familiar with the empirical and theoretical literature
    related to information seeking, including the recognition of

    use of information;
-   understand key concepts related to the ways in which information is
    created, structured, disseminated and used, with particular emphasis
    on scholarly information behaviors;
-   be able to investigate the ways in which the context of an
    information interaction can affect the process and outcomes of that
    interaction;
-   be able to investigate information behaviors and practices,
    including the impact of technology on human information
